A street.\\n\\n\\t[Enter RODERIGO and IAGO]\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tTush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly\\n\\tThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse\\n\\tAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\\n\\nIAGO\\t'Sblood, but you will not hear me:\\n\\tIf ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tThou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.\\n\\nIAGO\\tDespise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\\n\\tIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\\n\\tOff-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,\\n\\tI know my price, I am worth no worse a place:\\n\\tBut he; as loving his own pride and purposes,\\n\\tEvades them, with a bombast circumstance\\n\\tHorribly stuff'd with epithets of war;\\n\\tAnd, in conclusion,\\n\\tNonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,\\n\\t'I have already chose my officer.'\\n\\tAnd what was he?\\n\\tForsooth, a great arithmetician,\\n\\tOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\\n\\tA fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;\\n\\tThat never set a squadron in the field,\\n\\tNor the division of a battle knows\\n\\tMore than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,\\n\\tWherein the toged consuls can propose\\n\\tAs masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,\\n\\tIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:\\n\\tAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\\n\\tAt Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds\\n\\tChristian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd\\n\\tBy debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,\\n\\tHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\\n\\tAnd I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\\n\\nIAGO\\tWhy, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,\\n\\tPreferment goes by letter and affection,\\n\\tAnd not by old gradation, where each second\\n\\tStood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,\\n\\tWhether I in any just term am affined\\n\\tTo love the Moor.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tI would not follow him then.\\n\\nIAGO\\tO, sir, content you;\\n\\tI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\\n\\tWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\\n\\tCannot be truly follow'd.

For, sir,\\n\\tIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\\n\\tWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\\n\\tIn following him, I follow but myself;\\n\\tHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\\n\\tBut seeming so, for my peculiar end:\\n\\tFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\\n\\tThe native act and figure of my heart\\n\\tIn compliment extern, 'tis not long after\\n\\tBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\\n\\tFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tWhat a full fortune does the thicklips owe\\n\\tIf he can carry't thus!\\n\\nIAGO\\tCall up her father,\\n\\tRouse him: make after him, poison his delight,\\n\\tProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\\n\\tAnd, though he in a fertile climate dwell,\\n\\tPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\\n\\tYet throw such changes of vexation on't,\\n\\tAs it may lose some colour.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tHere is her father's house; I'll call aloud.\\n\\nIAGO\\tDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\\n\\tAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\\n\\tIs spied in populous cities.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tWhat, ho, Brabantio!

Because we come to\\n\\tdo you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll\\n\\thave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;\\n\\tyou'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have\\n\\tcoursers for cousins and gennets for germans.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tWhat profane wretch art thou?\\n\\nIAGO\\tI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter\\n\\tand the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tThou art a villain.\\n\\nIAGO\\tYou are--a senator.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tThis thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tSir, I will answer any thing.

Do not believe\\n\\tThat, from the sense of all civility,\\n\\tI thus would play and trifle with your reverence:\\n\\tYour daughter, if you have not given her leave,\\n\\tI say again, hath made a gross revolt;\\n\\tTying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes\\n\\tIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\\n\\tOf here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:\\n\\tIf she be in her chamber or your house,\\n\\tLet loose on me the justice of the state\\n\\tFor thus deluding you.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tStrike on the tinder, ho!\\n\\tGive me a taper! call up all my people!\\n\\tThis accident is not unlike my dream:\\n\\tBelief of it oppresses me already.\\n\\tLight, I say! light!\\n\\n\\t[Exit above]\\n\\nIAGO\\tFarewell; for I must leave you:\\n\\tIt seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,\\n\\tTo be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--\\n\\tAgainst the Moor: for, I do know, the state,\\n\\tHowever this may gall him with some cheque,\\n\\tCannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd\\n\\tWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\\n\\tWhich even now stand in act, that, for their souls,\\n\\tAnother of his fathom they have none,\\n\\tTo lead their business: in which regard,\\n\\tThough I do hate him as I do hell-pains.\\n\\tYet, for necessity of present life,\\n\\tI must show out a flag and sign of love,\\n\\tWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\\n\\tLead to the Sagittary the raised search;\\n\\tAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\\n\\n\\t[Exit]\\n\\n\\t[Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches]\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tIt is too true an evil: gone she is;\\n\\tAnd what's to come of my despised time\\n\\tIs nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,\\n\\tWhere didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!\\n\\tWith the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!\\n\\tHow didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me\\n\\tPast thought!

O treason of the blood!\\n\\tFathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds\\n\\tBy what you see them act. Is there not charms\\n\\tBy which the property of youth and maidhood\\n\\tMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\\n\\tOf some such thing?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tYes, sir, I have indeed.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!\\n\\tSome one way, some another. Do you know\\n\\tWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tI think I can discover him, if you please,\\n\\tTo get good guard and go along with me.\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\tPray you, lead on.

O my sweet,\\n\\tI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\\n\\tIn mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,\\n\\tGo to the bay and disembark my coffers:\\n\\tBring thou the master to the citadel;\\n\\tHe is a good one, and his worthiness\\n\\tDoes challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,\\n\\tOnce more, well met at Cyprus.\\n\\n\\t[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]\\n\\nIAGO\\tDo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come\\n\\thither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base\\n\\tmen being in love have then a nobility in their\\n\\tnatures more than is native to them--list me. The\\n\\tlieutenant tonight watches on the court of\\n\\tguard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is\\n\\tdirectly in love with him.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tWith him! why, 'tis not possible.\\n\\nIAGO\\tLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.\\n\\tMark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,\\n\\tbut for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:\\n\\tand will she love him still for prating? let not\\n\\tthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;\\n\\tand what delight shall she have to look on the\\n\\tdevil? When the blood is made dull with the act of\\n\\tsport, there should be, again to inflame it and to\\n\\tgive satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,\\n\\tsympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which\\n\\tthe Moor is defective in: now, for want of these\\n\\trequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness will\\n\\tfind itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,\\n\\tdisrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will\\n\\tinstruct her in it and compel her to some second\\n\\tchoice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most\\n\\tpregnant and unforced position--who stands so\\n\\teminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio\\n\\tdoes? a knave very voluble; no further\\n\\tconscionable than in putting on the mere form of\\n\\tcivil and humane seeming, for the better compassing\\n\\tof his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,\\n\\tnone; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a\\n\\tfinder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and\\n\\tcounterfeit advantages, though true advantage never\\n\\tpresent itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the\\n\\tknave is handsome, young, and hath all those\\n\\trequisites in him that folly and green minds look\\n\\tafter: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman\\n\\thath found him already.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tI cannot believe that in her; she's full of\\n\\tmost blessed condition.\\n\\nIAGO\\tBlessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of\\n\\tgrapes: if she had been blessed, she would never\\n\\thave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou\\n\\tnot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst\\n\\tnot mark that?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tYes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.\\n\\nIAGO\\tLechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue\\n\\tto the history of lust and foul thoughts.

But, sir, be you ruled by me: I\\n\\thave brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;\\n\\tfor the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows\\n\\tyou not. I'll not be far from you: do you find\\n\\tsome occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking\\n\\ttoo loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what\\n\\tother course you please, which the time shall more\\n\\tfavourably minister.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tWell.\\n\\nIAGO\\tSir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply\\n\\tmay strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for\\n\\teven out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to\\n\\tmutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true\\n\\ttaste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\\n\\tshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by\\n\\tthe means I shall then have to prefer them; and the\\n\\timpediment most profitably removed, without the\\n\\twhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tI will do this, if I can bring it to any\\n\\topportunity.\\n\\nIAGO\\tI warrant thee.

Now, I do love her too;\\n\\tNot out of absolute lust, though peradventure\\n\\tI stand accountant for as great a sin,\\n\\tBut partly led to diet my revenge,\\n\\tFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\\n\\tHath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof\\n\\tDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;\\n\\tAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\\n\\tTill I am even'd with him, wife for wife,\\n\\tOr failing so, yet that I put the Moor\\n\\tAt least into a jealousy so strong\\n\\tThat judgment cannot cure.
